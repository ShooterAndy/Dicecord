**pick** allows you to randomly pick a value from a list of comma-separated values.

If left with no parameters, will open a pop-window instead.

Examples:
`/pick items:Alice, Bob, Candy, Dennis, ...` — will pick one of the names from this list.
`/pick items:Alice, Bob, Candy, Dennis, ... amount:3` — will pick three of the names from this list.
`/pick items:Alice, Bob, Candy, Dennis, ... show_remaining:True` — will pick one of the names from this list and show the remaining items as well.
