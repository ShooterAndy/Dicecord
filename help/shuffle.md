**shuffle** (`sh`) shuffles a deck of cards of your choosing (`poker` by default). Each Discord channel has its own deck.
You need to shuffle a deck on the server at least once before drawing any cards from it.

See `!help listDeckTypes` to learn more about deck types and how to list them.

Examples:
* `!shuffle` — will shuffle and save a standard 54-card (52 normal + 2 jokers) `poker` deck for this channel.
* `!shuffle nouveau` — will shuffle and save a Tarot Nouveau deck for this channel.
