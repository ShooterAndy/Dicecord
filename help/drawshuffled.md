**drawshuffled** allows you to draw a number of cards from a freshly shuffled deck.
The deck that is created by the `!shuffle` command is not affected by the use of this command.

Example:
`!drawshuffle 3 Some comment` â€” will show you three random cards (from a standard 54 cards deck) and preface them with your comment.
