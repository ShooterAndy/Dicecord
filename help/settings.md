Dicecord currently only has one setting, which is a way to disable the default "Command not found" error message. This is accomplished by adding a special role to your Discord server and assigning it
to Dicecord.

Go to your Server Settings â†’ Roles, add a new role named `DICECORD_NO_NOT_FOUND`. Then add this role to Dicecord on your server.
