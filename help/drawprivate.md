**drawPrivate** (`drpr`) allows you to draw a number of cards from the top of a deck. It will then DM you these cards.

Note that if oyu don't need to have a deck that is shared for a text channel on your server, you can just `!shuffle` in the Dicecord's DMs. 

See `!help shuffle` for more info about the deck itself.
See `!help draw` for a command that will show the drawn cards in the channel instead.

Example:
`!drawprivate 3 Some comment` â€” will DM you three cards, removing them from the deck, and preface them with your comment.
