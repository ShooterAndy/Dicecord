**setprefix** command allows to set a command prefix this bot will use.

By default, the exclamation point `!` is used as a command prefix, but it can be changed on a per-Guild basis by that Guild's administrator.

Discord-reserved symbols, such as `@`, `#`, `*`, `_`, `~`, `:`, or `||` (as well as the backtick), and white-space symbols are not allowed to be used in a prefix. Also, the prefix can't start with a `/` symbol. The maximum length of a prefix is capped at 8 symbols.
