**rollSaved** (`rs`) command allows you to roll a saved roll command.

The syntax for that is as follows:
```!rollSaved comand-name```

This will roll a saved roll command by that name and show you the results of those rolls. Obviously,
you have to have saved a roll command via `!saveRoll` prior to attempting to roll it.

If you would like to edit some values in the roll command for this specific instance, you can get
this roll command's text via the `!getSaved` command. You can then copy and paste that text and
edit it as you see fit before rolling.
