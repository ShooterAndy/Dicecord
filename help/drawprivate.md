**drawPrivate** (`drpr`) allows you to draw a number of cards (1 by default) from the top of a deck. It will then DM you these cards.

Note that if you don't need to have a deck that is shared for a text channel on your server, you can just `!shuffle` in the Dicecord's DMs and use the normal `!draw` there. 

See `!help shuffle` for more info about the deck itself.
See `!help draw` for a command that will show the drawn cards in the channel instead.

Example:
`!drawprivate 3 Some comment` — will DM you three cards, removing them from the channel deck, and preface them with your comment.
`!drpr` — will DM you one card, removing it from the channel deck.
