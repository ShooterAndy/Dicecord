**Dicecord** currently doesn't need any permissions to work properly, except just one: View Channel.

If you are reading this, you probably encountered a problem with the bot not having access to a channel you've issued commands to it in. To fix this, you can do either of these things:

* Add whichever Role that already has permissions to view this channel to **Dicecord**;
* Create a new Role, add it to **Dicecord**, go to the channel's settings â†’ Permissions, select the new Role, and click on the checkmark next to the "View Channel" permission to make it green.

To check that this worked, make sure that **Dicecord** appears in the list of users for your channel. If you are still experiencing problems, please contact me (see `/help` for the invitation link to the support server).
