**deleteSaved** (`ds`) command allows you to delete a saved roll command.

The syntax for that is as follows:
```!deleteSaved comand-name```

This will delete your saved roll command by that name, allowing you to save more roll commands in 
its place. Obviously, you have to have saved a roll command via `!saveRoll` prior to attempting to 
delete it.
