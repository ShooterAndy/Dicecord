Dicecord currently has these settings:

`DICECORD_NO_NOT_FOUND` is a way to disable the default "Command not found" error message.\
`DICECORD_DO_NOT_REPLY` is a way to make Dicecord not mention you in its replies to your commands.\
`DICECORD_NO_REACTIONS` is a way to disable the interactive emoji reactions (see `/help topic:roll` for more info.)

Setting these options is accomplished by adding a special role to your Discord server and assigning it to Dicecord.

To do so, go to your Server Settings â†’ Roles, add a new role named with one of the special names listed above, then add this role to the Dicecord bot on your server.
