**getSaved** (`gs`) command allows you to get the text of a saved roll command.

The syntax for that is as follows:
```!getSaved comand-name```

This will return the text of your saved roll command by that name. Obviously, you have to have saved
a roll command via `!saveRoll` prior to attempting to get its text.

After you get the text, you can copy and paste it into your message textarea to edit it as you see
fit. To roll the saved command without any changes, you can use the `!rollSaved` command instead.
