**draw** (`dr`) allows you to draw a number of cards (1 by default) from the top of a deck.
See `!help shuffle` for more info about the deck itself.
See `!help drawshuffled` for a command that does neither require nor affect a pre-shuffled deck.

Example:
`!draw 3 Some comment` — will show you three cards, removing them from the channel deck, and preface them with your comment.
`!dr` — will show you one card, removing it from the channel deck.
