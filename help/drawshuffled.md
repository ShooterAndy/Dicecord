**drawShuffled** (`drsh`) allows you to draw a number of cards (1 by default) from a freshly shuffled deck of your choosing (`poker` by default).
The deck that is created by the `!shuffle` command is not affected by the use of this command.

See `!help listDeckTypes` to learn more about deck types and how to list them.

Examples:
* `!drawshuffle 3 ? Some comment` — will show you three random cards (from a standard 54-cards `poker` deck) and preface them with your comment.
* `!drsh 3 rider-waite Some comment` — will show you three random cards from the Rider-Waite Tarot deck and preface them with your comment.
* `!drsh` — will show you one random card from a standard 54-cards `poker` deck.
